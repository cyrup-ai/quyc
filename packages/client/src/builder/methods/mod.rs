//! HTTP method implementations
//!
//! This module provides terminal methods for executing HTTP requests with different
//! builder states and configurations.
//!
//! All methods maintain the streaming-first architecture and provide comprehensive
//! documentation with examples.

// Empty module - all method implementations have been moved to the API package
// which provides its own implementations directly on Http3Builder states
